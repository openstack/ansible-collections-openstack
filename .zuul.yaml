# Keep parent jobs in sync between branches to avoid issues e.g. with job scheduling. Zuul CI will search in master
# branch first when collecting job variants during job freeze which can have unwanted side effects. For example, when
# parent job *-base has been changed in stable/1.0.0 branch, Zuul could still use *-base variants from master branch
# during job freeze on child jobs such as *-ussuri-ansible-2.11 etc.
#
# Do not share job definitions with the job.branches attribute across multiple branches. Do not define jobs which are
# specific to other branches, except for parent jobs which are shared across branches. For example, to not add a job
# which is specific for the stable/1.0.0 branch to the .zuul.yaml in master branch. In particular do not use the
# job.branches directive on a job which will be copied to multiple branches. When you have multiple copies of a job with
# the job.branches attribute, Zuul CI could pick any of the job definitions which might not be the one you expected.
